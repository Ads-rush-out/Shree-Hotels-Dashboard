**1. Shree Hotels Analytics: Comprehensive Hotel Operations & Performance Intelligence Dashboard**

A robust, interactive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze hotel branch performance, operational capacity, facility distribution, and service readiness across multiple locations. The dashboard transforms raw hotel data into meaningful business insights that support strategic decision-making in the hospitality industry.


**2. Short Description:**

The Shree Hotels Analytics Dashboard is a data-driven Power BI reporting solution designed to provide hotel management with a centralized and holistic view of their operations. The dashboard enables users to evaluate branch-wise performance, compare infrastructure and facilities, assess service quality, and identify opportunities for operational improvement and business growth.

This dashboard serves as a decision-support tool for hotel administrators, regional managers, business analysts, and stakeholders seeking to improve efficiency, guest experience, and revenue potential.

**3. Tech Stack:**

The dashboard was built using a modern Business Intelligence stack with a focus on scalability, clarity, and performance:

- 📊 Power BI Desktop - Used as the primary platform for creating interactive visuals, reports, and dashboards with advanced filtering and drill-down capabilities.

- 📂 Power Query (ETL Layer) - Responsible for data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and reshaping. Tasks included:
•  Standardizing city and state nmes
•  Converting Yes/No facility indicators into analytical fields
•  Creating structured tables for efficient modeling

- 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) - Used to build calculated measures and columns such as:
•  Total room count
•  Average star rating
•  Revenue performance metrics
•  Facility availability counts
•  Conditional KPIs and aggregations

- 🧩 Data Modeling - Relationships established between hotel branches, facilities, room attributes, and performance metrics to enable cross-filtering and accurate aggregation.

- 📁 File Formats -
• pbit / .pbix – Power BI development and template files
• png – Dashboard previews for documentation and portfolio use

**4. Data Source**
The dataset represents an imaginative hotel chain operating across multiple cities and states in India. It is designed to closely mirror real-world hospitality data structures and operational attributes.
- Dataset Includes:
•  Branch Information:
      City, State, Manager Name, Contact Details
•  Operational Metrics:
      Number of rooms, revenue score, star rating
•  Facility Attributes:
      Pool, Gym, Spa, Restaurant, Bar, Conference Hall, Valet Service, Garden, etc.
•  Service & Infrastructure Indicators:
      Designed to assess service quality, guest convenience, and operational maturity
The dataset is structured in a way that allows advanced analytics, filtering, and future scalability.

**5. Features / Highlights**
- **Business Problem**
Hotel chains often manage multiple properties across different locations, each with varying levels of performance, infrastructure, and service quality. Without a centralized analytics system, it becomes challenging to answer key business questions such as:
•  Which hotel branches are generating better operational value?
•  How evenly are premium facilities distributed across locations?
•  Are higher star-rated hotels actually delivering stronger performance?
•  Which cities or states require infrastructure upgrades or strategic focus?
•  Traditional spreadsheets or static reports are insufficient to provide quick, actionable insights at scale.

- **Goal of the Dashboard**
The primary objective of this dashboard is to deliver an interactive, intuitive, and visually rich analytics solution that:
•  Centralizes hotel performance data into a single view
•  Enables branch-level and regional comparisons
•  Highlights strengths, weaknesses, and operational gaps
•  Supports management in data-driven decision-making
•  Improves planning for expansion, renovation, and service enhancement

## 🎯 Business Problem

Hotel chains managing multiple properties across different locations face challenges such as:

- ❓ Which hotel branches are generating better operational value?
- 🏊 How evenly are premium facilities distributed across locations?
- ⭐ Are higher star-rated hotels delivering stronger performance?
- 📍 Which cities or states require infrastructure upgrades or strategic focus?

Traditional spreadsheets and static reports are insufficient for providing quick, actionable insights at scale.

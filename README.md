**1. Project Title / Headline**
Shree Hotels Analytics: Comprehensive Hotel Operations & Performance Intelligence Dashboard
A robust, interactive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze hotel branch performance, operational capacity, facility distribution, and service readiness across multiple locations. The dashboard transforms raw hotel data into meaningful business insights that support strategic decision-making in the hospitality industry.

**2. Short Description / Purpose**
The Shree Hotels Analytics Dashboard is a data-driven Power BI reporting solution designed to provide hotel management with a centralized and holistic view of their operations. The dashboard enables users to evaluate branch-wise performance, compare infrastructure and facilities, assess service quality, and identify opportunities for operational improvement and business growth.

This dashboard serves as a decision-support tool for hotel administrators, regional managers, business analysts, and stakeholders seeking to improve efficiency, guest experience, and revenue potential.

**3. Tech Stack**
The dashboard was built using a modern Business Intelligence stack with a focus on scalability, clarity, and performance:
• 📊 Power BI Desktop - Used as the primary platform for creating interactive visuals, reports, and dashboards with advanced filtering and drill-down capabilities.
• 📂 Power Query (ETL Layer) - Responsible for data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and reshaping. Tasks included:
    . Standardizing city and state nmes
    . Converting Yes/No facility indicators into analytical fields
    . Creating structured tables for efficient modeling
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) - Used to build calculated measures and columns such as:
    . Total room count
    . Average star rating
    . Revenue performance metrics
    . Facility availability counts
    . Conditional KPIs and aggregations
• 🧩 Data Modeling - Relationships established between hotel branches, facilities, room attributes, and performance metrics to enable cross-filtering and accurate aggregation.
• 📁 File Formats -
    . pbit / .pbix – Power BI development and template files
    . png – Dashboard previews for documentation and portfolio use

**4. Data Source**
The dataset represents an imaginative hotel chain operating across multiple cities and states in India. It is designed to closely mirror real-world hospitality data structures and operational attributes.
• Dataset Includes:
    . Branch Information:
      City, State, Manager Name, Contact Details
    . Operational Metrics:
      Number of rooms, revenue score, star rating
    . Facility Attributes:
      Pool, Gym, Spa, Restaurant, Bar, Conference Hall, Valet Service, Garden, etc.
    . Service & Infrastructure Indicators:
      Designed to assess service quality, guest convenience, and operational maturity
The dataset is structured in a way that allows advanced analytics, filtering, and future scalability.

**5. Features / Highlights**
• Business Problem
Hotel chains often manage multiple properties across different locations, each with varying levels of performance, infrastructure, and service quality. Without a centralized analytics system, it becomes challenging to answer key business questions such as:
   . Which hotel branches are generating better operational value?
   . How evenly are premium facilities distributed across locations?
   . Are higher star-rated hotels actually delivering stronger performance?
   . Which cities or states require infrastructure upgrades or strategic focus?
   . Traditional spreadsheets or static reports are insufficient to provide quick, actionable insights at scale.

• Goal of the Dashboard
The primary objective of this dashboard is to deliver an interactive, intuitive, and visually rich analytics solution that:
   . Centralizes hotel performance data into a single view
   . Enables branch-level and regional comparisons
   . Highlights strengths, weaknesses, and operational gaps
   . Supports management in data-driven decision-making
   . Improves planning for expansion, renovation, and service enhancement

• Walkthrough of Key Visuals
**1. Executive KPI Summary (Top Section)**
Provides a high-level snapshot of hotel chain performance, including:
   . Total number of hotel branches
   . Total and average room count
   . Average star rating across branches
   . Average revenue score
   . Count of branches offering premium facilities
This section allows executives to understand overall performance at a glance.

**2. Geographic Distribution Analysis**
Visuals display hotel presence by City and State, helping users:
   . Identify regions with high hotel density
   . Compare regional performance patterns
   . Spot underrepresented or high-potential locations

**3. Branch Performance Comparison**
Bar and column charts compare:
   . Room count by hotel branch
   . Revenue score by location
   . Star rating versus operational capacity
This enables quick identification of high-performing and underperforming branches.

**4. Facility & Infrastructure Analysis**
Stacked and matrix visuals illustrate the availability of facilities such as:
   . Swimming Pool
   . Gym
   . Spa
   . Restaurant & Bar
   . Conference Hall
   . Valet Service
This analysis helps determine:
   . Service consistency across branches
   . Gaps in premium offerings
   . Competitive readiness of each location

5. Rating & Revenue Correlation Insights
Visuals analyze the relationship between:
   . Star rating and room capacity
   . Star rating and revenue score
   . This helps validate whether higher ratings translate into better operational performance.

**6. Interactive Filters & Slicers**
Users can dynamically filter the dashboard by:
   . City
   . State
   . Star Rating
   . Facility availability
This interactivity allows deep-dive analysis tailored to specific business needs.

• Business Impact & Insights
   . Operational Efficiency:
     Identifies branches that require infrastructure upgrades or better resource allocation
   . Strategic Expansion Planning:
     Highlights cities and states with strong performance and growth potential
   . Service Quality Improvement:
     Reveals gaps in premium facilities affecting guest experience
   . Performance Benchmarking:
     Enables fair comparison of branches across regions and categories
   . Executive Decision Support:
     Translates complex data into clear, actionable insights for leadership

**6. Conclusion**
The Shree Hotels Analytics Dashboard demonstrates the practical application of Power BI in solving real-world hospitality business problems. By integrating data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visualizations, this project showcases strong analytical thinking and business intelligence skills.

The dashboard provides measurable value by enabling faster decisions, better resource planning, and improved service quality—making it a powerful analytical asset for hotel management.
